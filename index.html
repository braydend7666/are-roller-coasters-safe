        <h6> Roller Coasters, giant machines made of wood or steel, are built to terrify riders. With their many inversions, numerous airtime moments, high speeds, and large drops, Roller Coasters thrill millions of riders every year. Crowds flock to Amusement Parks such as Cedar Point and Disney World. In fact rcdb.com states there are 461 operating parks in North America with around 900 roller coasters! There is certainly a plethora of coasters some dating back to over 100 years ago. If you are like me you love coasters. I actually consider myself a Roller Coaster Enthusiast! Roller Coasters are my favorite thing to do, however I didn’t always like coasters. I like many people had an irrational fear of Roller Coasters. I thought I would fly out or the train would derail. But what changed you may be asking. I looked up the safety of coasters and in a matter of months I was riding coasters! So in this website I am not going to say YOU HAVE TO RIDE COASTERS! I just want to explore a question that many people ask. Are Roller Coasters safe?

        <h6>Have you ever heard of Murphy’s Law? Murphy’s law states “If anything can go wrong it will.” Roller Coaster designers and Parks recingze the importance Murphy’s law. That is why Roller Coasters have something called fail-safes. A fail-safe is a device, mechanism, or protocol that will be triggered if any failure in the ride occurs. Coasters have hundreds of fail-safes that keep millions of riders safe in case something happens. Below are just a select few fail-safes iofncluded on coasters. </h6>

              <h3 class="header-h3">Sensors</h3>
              </div>
            <div class="col-sm fail-safe">Knowing where a train is on the track is a necessity for the coaster operators. Most Roller Coasters today have a very powerful computer helping to run the ride. These computers monitor everything from the status of each restraint to the position of the train on the track. Coasters often have many sensors placed throughout the layout which feeds information to the ride operator. Without these small yet powerful tools Operators would not receive real-time information on the whereabouts of every train.

              </div>
            <div class="col-sm fail-safe">Roller Coasters often have more than one train on the track at a time. This is done to boost capacity in order to keep the lines moving throughout the day. To understand the use of Block Brakes you must understand Block Sections. Roller coasters are divided into sections that are only allowed to have one train in that section. In order to separate these sections Roller Coasters have block brakes. These Brakes are capable of stopping a train if the block ahead is occupied. Without these block sections, trains would risk hitting each other.

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm fail-safe">Have you ever wondered what that click-clack sound on Roller Coasters is? As trains rise up a lift they build potential energy. If the chain was to stop for whatever reason the train would stop, instead of rolling back down the lift hill. That is the magic of an anti-rollback device. That clicking sound commonly heard was the anti-rollback device passing over groves next to the chain. If the chain stops for any reason the train will catch on to the groves and will not move backward. Then either riders will be removed from the train or the ride will start moving again momentarily.

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm fail-safe">A fear for many people is that they may fly out of the train. This is not the case however. Not only do restraints have their own fail-safes there is a test seat outside most coasters. THESE TEST SEATS ARE NOT JUST AWESOME PHOTO OPS. A test seat is the same seat that will be on the ride. Sitting in the test seat and pulling down the restraint will make a little green light turn on if the restraint can lock. This means if you are the right height and the green light goes off, then you won’t fly out. Use test seats if you are unsure about if the ride can accommodate you.

      <h6>In conclusion, while designed to be intimidating, Roller Coasters are extremely safe. Millions of riders each year will depart on thrilling journeys on these complex machines. But an important thing to remember is that accidents do happen. No matter what activity anybody does there is a possibility of an accident and that is something we must live with. But as time goes on and more coasters get built the safety of them will only improve. As stated in the introduction, the goal of this website is not to tell you to ride coasters. Because some people just might not riding coasters and that is okay. But whether you are riding coasters or not, hopefully, you understand that roller coasters are safe.
