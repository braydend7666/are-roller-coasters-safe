# Entry 4

As of right now I have a good understanding of my tool. There is still more to learn but I have the overall gist. Animate.css is a linkable library. I can add a class called “animated” and then specify what animation and speed I want. Because I have so much more time I might try to implement a bit of javascript or some conditionals. I don’t know the use yet but it is a cool thing to learn! Never know when I might need it.
