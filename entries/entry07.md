# Entry 6

In my last blog entry, I said that I started to code and was currently working on my introduction. Since I have finished that, I also worked more on my Engineering Design Process. I finished a paragraph about “What is a fail-safe.” In addition I added 3 columns on my website that will stack on mobile. I did this because I want the name of the fail-safe, a description, and an image. 

Since drafting my MVP I have strayed away from it. The content and layout is the same, the difference is that it looks very different. A skill I noticed from this was adaptation. Even though I am straying away from what I drafted, I still am able to put all the content I need to. In addition to adaptation, I also have learned about time management. By making a schedule and working every day, I am actually ahead of what I originally planned. That is really good because then I will have more time to work beyond my MVP.
