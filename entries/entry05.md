# Entry 5

Since my last blog entry I have mainly been tinkering in order to reinforce my understanding of Animate.css. I have also been trying different combinations of animations in order to make my website look more “alive.” Here is a link to one combination that I really like https://jsbin.com/gemulowaca/edit?html,output. Some things I learned from tinkering was that for 2 animations that are opposite it looks better for them to be closer together. So in my example I used  margin: 10px;. Another thing I learned from tinkering is that any animations should go towards the middle. However if they are not in the middle they need to take the longest path. 

I feel like I have tinkered and learnt enough in order to start my website. I understand there is always room for improvement so I still want to get better at this tool. As I said in my last blog entry I want to learn some javascript to implement into animate.css. In the future I also want to experiment with emphasizing certain words with animations. I would most likely use heartbeat because it does not look like it will block the text around it. However I could be wrong! The only way to find out is to try it yourself. 

I feel that since my last entry I have really become better at tinkering. I know this because I have just had more time in order to tinker and really work with less distractions.
