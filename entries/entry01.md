# Entry 1

When deciding on a website to make many ideas crossed my mind. I could talk about AI or cybersecurity. But I much rather talk about something near and dear to my heart. If you know me you know that I love roller coasters. I am a roller coaster enthusiast and a big adrenaline junkie. Roller Coasters are the best way to get an adrenaline and have a great time, but some people have a fear of coasters! I have some friends that go on with me but I have some that are so scared. Some people think the restraint will come off, the coaster will derail, they will be stuck or they are afraid of height, speed or inversions.This saddens me because roller coasters are safer than they ever have been in history. Roller coasters are built with fail safes and thousands of sensors to make sure every guest is safe. While researching my topic, I came across some great websites such as www.coasterbot.com , www.coaster101.com and www.coasterbuzz.com. These websites show the safety and precision that goes into building and maintaining a roller coaster. Through my research I've focused on the skill of crowdsourcing. By using forums and many different websites, I was able to figure out the right information. As of right now I am still thinking about a basic concept on how my website will look and function.
