# Entry 6

Since my last blog entry, I have finished planning my website and I have now started coding it. Because I am using a lot of Bootstrap in my website https://getbootstrap.com/ is a very helpful tool. This website contains an astonishing amount of information about Bootstrap and starter code to put in your websites. My UI is going to be very simple and minimalistic but still have interactivity from the navbar. I want my UI to be like this because my website doesn’t need the reader to do anything except read the content I put. In regards to my engineering design process I have finished planing and I have started coding my website. What I have completed so far is my header which contains a navbar, an image, and some animate.css. I am currently working on the introduction to my website on google docs. The reason I am doing this is to make sure I have no errors in my paragraph. Then I can simply copy and paste my intro and I will know it is grammatically correct. Some notable skills that I have gained from the freedom project is not only planning but also organizing notes. After a few months, The notes that I took are still readable. That just shows how good of a skill synthesizing notes can be. After this blog entry, I am going to work on my website’s introduction.
