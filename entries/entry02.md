After blog one I continued my research on the saftey of roller coaster. I kept reading online formums and major news articles. What I found was rather shocking. Major news outlets over dramatize routine operations such as an e-stop (stop on lift hill or brake run). Coasters have 100's of fail safes and that also is one of them. I learned a bit about how the lift hill works and also how magnets are used on some coasters. The news often scares people out of coasters and I hope my website will fix that. 

In addition to learning about e-stop's I also synthesized my notes on google docs. Because I gathered messy notes I appeared to be a wall of text. Now that I used bullet points and proper indentation, my notes are very easy to read. This will help me when making a website because all of the info that need is organized.
