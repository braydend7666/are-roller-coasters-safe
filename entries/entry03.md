# Entry 3

After my second blog entry, I decided on a tool to learn. I picked animate.css because of the animations I can make using a very simple library. Animate.css enables me to make text behave how I want. For example, I am able to make text wiggle and shake in order to catch a reader's eye. Important things can be emphasized by movement instead of using bold text. This makes my website feel more alive, instead of being a wall of text.
