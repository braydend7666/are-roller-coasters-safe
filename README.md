# SEP11 Freedom Project

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about Independently studying a topic. The purpose of this blog is to show our thought process through making the website.

## Content
For my project, I am making a website about roller coasters using Github, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and animate.css . This blog will walk through my process of independently studying animate.css and making the website.

## Product

## Presentation

## Implications
I intend to eliminate the fear of roller coasters by showing how safe they are.
